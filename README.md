cryptsy.php -> cryptsy api same as in cryptsy.com

tool.php -> "arbitrage" functions

NET-LTC-XPM-NET.php -> file for this loop

This project depends on a webserver with php support, If you use this on a public server you _MUST_ use a .htaccess to protect the directory with a password, you have to fill your apikey and secret in cryptsy.php then run NET-LTC-XPM-NET.php.

At this time the app have unknow bugs, please report them, everything _should_ be working but do compare the output against cryptsy site before placing orders.
